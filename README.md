# txVanityPlateChecker-Lightweight
## A mini version of my [txVanityPlateChecker](https://github.com/bestadamdagoat/txVanityPlateChecker). Only outputs valid plates and errors (such as incapsula errors).
### The only setting you can change is wait time between checks (has to be modified within the code).
#### Check the mini branch for a basic branch with only the necessities. (you'll need to supply your own query.txt file and install requirements without a requirements.txt [unless you were to take it from here ;)]).
